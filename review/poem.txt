In the quiet of dawn's first light,
Where dreams still linger in the flight,
There brews a potion dark and deep,
Rousing souls from slumber's keep.

In a cup, a world unfurls,
Swirls of steam in gentle twirls.
Aroma rich, and flavor bold,
Stories in each sip are told.

Bitter, sweet, a complex tale,
In every cup, a journey set sail.
From mountain high to valley low,
In every bean, a secret glow.

Coffee, oh! A faithful friend,
On whom so many mornings depend.
A muse for weary minds to find,
A moment's peace, a break unbind.

In its warmth, a comfort true,
A simple joy in morning's hue.
A bond shared in cups clinked,
In this brew, our lives are linked.

So here's to coffee, dark and strong,
A daily ritual, a lifelong song.
In each sip, a story anew,
In every cup, a dream come true.
